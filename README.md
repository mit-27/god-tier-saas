This stack ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable application with strong typing throughout the entire codebase and secure authentication.

## Project Structure

- apps/web - The Next.js web application
- apps/server - The Nest.js API server
- packages/shared - The shared module which manages the database and ts-rest router for both the web and Server projects

## Setup and Running Instructions

### 1. üê≥ Using Docker

To set up and run the project using Docker Compose:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Copy the example environment files and add appropriate environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   cp .env.example .env
   cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
   cp packages/shared/.env.example packages/shared/.env
   ```

   Edit `.env` files and add the necessary environment variables. Follow instructions in each file and modify the values according to your environment and the way you want to run the app.

4. Remove all node_modules

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules .pnpm-store ./apps/web/node_modules ./apps/server/node_modules ./packages/shared/node_modules ./apps/server/dist pg_data
   ```

5. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

This command will build and start all the necessary containers defined in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.

## 2. üì¶ Using pnpm (Local Development)

To set up and run the project locally using pnpm:

1. Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and pnpm installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Copy the example environment files and add appropriate environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   cp .env.example .env
   cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
   cp packages/shared/.env.example packages/shared/.env
   ```

   Edit both `.env` files and add the necessary environment variables. Here docker-compose.postgres.yml used db credentials from .env file. So make sure the credentails that you used in apps.server/.env and packages.shared/.env are same as root .env file. Follow instructions in each file and modify the values according to your environment and the way you want to run the app.

4. Install the dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Build the shared module

   ```bash
   pnpm run build:shared 
   ```

6. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
   ```

7. Start the development servers by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

This command will concurrently start both the Next.js web application (on port 8090) and the NestJS API server with shared module which manages db and ts-rest router. It uses Turbo to manage the monorepo workspace and run the development scripts for both the web and API projects simultaneously.

Make sure your environment variables are properly configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database started by Docker Compose.
